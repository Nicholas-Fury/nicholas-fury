            <div class="about-content">
                <p>One of the earliest photos of me shows a kid at the dinner table with a screwdriver in one hand and a toy in the other. That toy was either broken or about to be. Growing up, it was rare that broken things were replaced. Being curious, broken things got explored, taken apart, and if I was lucky, fixed. What started as curiosity became a methodology. I began learning how systems worked by deconstructing them, eventually developing a talent for making them not just functional again, but fundamentally better. My Nerf guns lasted longer and fired farther. My bike chain stayed on and my brakes started working again. These childhood experiments taught me something powerful: exploring leads to understanding, understanding enables improvement, and systematic improvement transforms possibilities.</p>
                
                <p>That mindset has become my professional signature. While I still love building things that work well, I've found my greatest impact comes from identifying organizational friction points and transforming them into frameworks that scale. This curiosity-driven approach has led me to create solutions that fundamentally changed how teams, programs, and businesses operate. I've reduced processes that took weeks to hours, converted manual tasks consuming hundreds of hours into automated systems completed in minutes, and turned siloed information into enterprise-wide visibility.</p>
                
                <p>The true power of curiosity, I've discovered, isn't just in personal exploration. It's in creating systems that empower others to achieve more with less effort. I believe in the multiplier effect of well-designed operational frameworks, where thoughtful automation and AI integration don't just save time but create space for human creativity and strategic thinking. When I see someone spending valuable hours on repetitive tasks, I don't just wonder how to make the process better, I reimagine it entirely.</p>
                
                <p>My greatest satisfaction comes from watching others adopt and build upon these frameworks, making them their own and extending their impact far beyond what I could achieve alone. Whether launching a new cross-organizational initiative, mentoring teams on operational excellence, or embedding AI-enhanced workflows into daily practices, I create environments where curiosity flourishes, collaboration thrives, and continuous improvement becomes cultural.</p>
                
                <p>At my core, I remain that curious kid with a screwdriver, just with better tools and a broader canvas. I'm here to explore, to transform, to scale impact, and to build systems that enable others to do the same.</p>
